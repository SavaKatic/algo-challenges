# Arrays & Hashing

This directory contains solutions for problems related to arrays and hashing. Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store collections of elements, while hashing involves the use of hash functions to map data to array indices for efficient retrieval.

## Problems

1. [Contains Duplicate](contains_duplicate)
   - Description: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
   - Difficulty: Easy

2. [Valid Anagram](valid_anagram)
   - Description: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
   - Difficulty: Easy

3. [Two Sum](two_sum)
   - Description: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
   - Difficulty: Easy

4. [Group Anagrams](group_anagrams)
   - Description: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
   - Difficulty: Medium

5. [Top K Frequent Elements](top_k_frequent_elements)
   - Description: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the k most frequent elements.
   - Difficulty: Medium

6. [Product of Array Except Self](product_of_array_except_self)
   - Description: Given an array `nums` of n integers where n > 1, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
   - Difficulty: Medium

7. [Valid Sudoku](valid_sudoku)
   - Description: Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
     1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
     2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
     3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
   - Difficulty: Medium

8. [Encode and Decode Strings](encode_and_decode_strings)
   - Description: Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
   - Difficulty: Medium

9. [Longest Consecutive Sequence](longest_consecutive_sequence)
   - Description: Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
   - Difficulty: Medium

## Solving Arrays & Hashing Problems

Arrays & hashing problems are typically solved using various techniques such as sorting, two pointers, hashing (using maps or sets), and sometimes dynamic programming. The general idea is to leverage the properties of arrays for efficient manipulation and use hashing for quick access and lookup. Here's a brief overview of common approaches:

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array can simplify many problems by arranging elements in a specific order, making it easier to identify patterns or find solutions.
- **Two Pointers**: This technique involves using two pointers to iterate through the array simultaneously, usually to find pairs or sequences that meet certain criteria.
- **Hashing**: Using hash maps or sets to store elements or their counts can provide efficient lookup and comparison operations, often reducing time complexity significantly.
- **Dynamic Programming**: For more complex problems that involve finding optimal solutions or maximizing/minimizing certain criteria, dynamic programming techniques can be employed to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and build up the solution incrementally.
